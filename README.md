# CSS: Landing page

This [task](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) aims to apply the newly learned CSS skills.
The Odin Project provided an example/ reference that one should recreate with HTML and CSS.
A focus is not a pixel-perfect creation, rather a similar result, which utilises `flexbox` for the layout.

## Lessons learned

Writing clear and clean CSS is super difficult.
Especially, considering the fact that one has to account for a well-structured HTML document.
Restricting the CSS to the various sections is not trivial, whilst maintaining aspects like size, centering, layout, etc.
Interesting would be how one can create the same layout with less CSS as `229` lines is a lot.
